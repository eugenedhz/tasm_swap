# tasm_swap
Two programs written in turbo assembler. You can use it to swap lists of numbers.

The first program swaps only one-byte unsigned 1-2 digit numbers.

The second swaps only two-byte 1-2 digit numbers.

Restrictions for count of digits are related to print function of lists.
Although you can just remove those print functions, and use only algrorithm to swap numbers in lists.

# How to use

You'll need 16-bit OS for that purpose.

Use TASM and TLINK to compile programs to .EXE or .COM files.
