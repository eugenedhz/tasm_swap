# tasm_swap
Two programs written in turbo assembler. You can use it to swap lists of numbers.

The first program swaps only one-byte unsigned 1-2 digit numbers.
The second swaps only two-byte 1-2 digit numbers.

# How to use

You'll need 16-bit OS for that purpose.

Use TASM and TLINK to compile programs to .EXE or .COM files.
